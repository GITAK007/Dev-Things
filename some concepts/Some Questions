(Q1) What is the difference between a <header> and <h1> tag ?

Ans-> The <header> tag is used to define a container for introductory 
       content or a set of navigational links. 
      It typically includes a logo or site title, and sometimes 
       the main navigation menu.
  where as,
         The <h1> tag, on the other hand, is used to define a heading.
         It is used to indicate the most important heading on a page,
         and typically contains the main topic of the page.
         It is one of six heading levels (h1-h6) that can be used to 
         indicate the hierarchy of headings on a page.
    
   ( In summary, the <header> tag is used to define a container for 
    introductory content and navigation, while the <h1> tag is used
     to define the main heading of a page. 
    The <header> tag can include other elements like <nav> and 
        <h1> as well as other headings.)

(Q2)Can footer have header tag ?

Ans -> No this isn't valid.
       The header element represents a header for the content,
        however the header element must not be a descendant of the
         footer element.
