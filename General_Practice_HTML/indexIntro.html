Metadata is —> in its very simplest definition — data that describes data.
 For example, an HTML document is data, but HTML can also contain metadata in its <head> element
 that describes the document — for example who wrote it, and its summary.

* The type of metadata provided by the <meta> element can be one of the following:

1) If the _name_ attribute is set, the <meta> element provides document-level metadata,
    applying to the whole page like (for mobile view or the pc or the big screen ).

2) If the _http-equiv_ attribute is set, the <meta> element is a pragma directive,
   providing information equivalent to what can be given by a similarly-named HTTP header.

3) If the _charset_ attribute is set, the <meta> element is a charset declaration,
   giving the character encoding in which the document is encoded.

4) If the _itemprop_ attribute is set, the <meta> element provides user-defined metadata.
